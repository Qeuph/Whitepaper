# Qeuph QUH: A Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Protocol

## Abstract
As quantum computing advances, it poses a significant threat to traditional cryptographic systems, including those used in blockchain technology. Qeuph QUH is a pioneering blockchain protocol designed to address these vulnerabilities. By integrating the FIPS 204 Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA-87), SHA3-512 hashing, and Bech32m addresses, Qeuph QUH offers unparalleled security, efficiency, and scalability. Compared to other quantum-resistant protocols, Qeuph QUH uses proven mechanisms such as "two-thirding" for block rewards, robust transaction validation, and quantum-resistant address generation. This whitepaper details the technical underpinnings and unique advantages of Qeuph QUH, setting a new standard for secure decentralized systems in the quantum era.

## 1. Introduction
Quantum computing presents an existential challenge to the cryptographic algorithms underlying most blockchain protocols. Estimates suggest that quantum computers capable of breaking widely used algorithms like secp256k1 and SHA2-256 may become unviable soon. Existing blockchain systems lack the necessary safeguards to withstand such advancements.

### Gaps in Current Protocols
- Vulnerability to quantum attacks on digital signatures and hashing.
- Inefficiencies in transaction processing and scalability.
- Limited mechanisms for sustaining long-term miner incentives.

### Qeuph QUH Solution
Qeuph QUH integrates:
- **ML-DSA-87**: A lattice-based digital signature standard that resists quantum attacks.
- **SHA3-512**: A robust hash function for enhanced data security.
- **Bech32m Encoding**: An efficient address format minimizing user errors.

## 2. Transactions
### 2.1 Key Features
A Qeuph QUH transaction is defined by its quantum-resistant design and structured validation process. Components include:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: References to previous outputs and designated recipients.
- **txnonce**: Ensures transaction uniqueness by incrementing for each new transaction, preventing replay attacks.
- **Digital Signatures**: Secured using ML-DSA-87.
- **Transaction IDs**: Derived from double SHA3-512 hashing.

### 2.2 Transaction Flow
1. User signs the transaction with their private key (4880 hexadecimal characters).
2. The transaction is broadcast to the network for validation.
3. Nodes verify inputs, outputs, and the txnonce for integrity.
4. Verified transactions are included in a block and hashed into the Merkle tree.

## 3. Address Generation
### 3.1 Process
1. **Public Key Derivation**: Generated using ML-DSA-87, resulting in a 2592-character hexadecimal string.
2. **Double Hashing**: The public key is hashed twice using SHA3-512 for added security.
3. **Bech32m Encoding**: The hash is encoded with the prefix `quh`, creating a user-friendly and error-resistant address.

### 3.2 Example
**Input Public Key**: `abcdef...` (2592 hex characters)  
**Double SHA3-512 Hash**: `123456...` (512 bits)  
**Bech32m Address**: `quh1lnt8...`  

### 3.3 Importance of Bech32m
Bech32m improves usability and reduces errors during address entry. Unlike traditional formats, it incorporates a checksum for quick validation, ensuring secure and efficient transactions.

## 4. Blocks and Consensus Mechanism
### 4.1 Block Structure
- **Header**: Includes metadata such as previous block hash, Merkle root, and nonce.
- **Block Time**: Fixed at 5 minutes for faster confirmation times.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Every 2048 blocks (approximately 7 days).

### 4.2 Consensus Algorithm
Qeuph QUH employs Proof-of-Work (PoW) with SHA3-512 for secure and efficient consensus.

### 4.3 Thirding Mechanism
Block rewards start at 50 QUH and decrease by two-third every 210,000 blocks. This ensures:
- Sustained miner incentives over time.
- A predictable and gradual coin supply distribution.

### 4.4 Total Supply 31500000 QUH OR 31.5 million QUH in words

## 5. Security Considerations
### 5.1 Comparison of ML-DSA-87
| Feature             | ML-DSA-87        | Other Lattice Algorithms |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Quantum Resistance | High             | Variable                 |
| Efficiency          | Optimized        | Mixed                    |
| Adoption            | FIPS Compliant   | Limited                  |

### 5.2 Attack Mitigations
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Addressed through secure hardware and implementation practices.
- **Replay Attacks**: Mitigated using txnonce.
- **Quantum Threats**: Neutralized by ML-DSA-87’s lattice-based approach.

### 5.3 Example
Consider a quantum computer attempting to forge a transaction. ML-DSA-87’s lattice-based hardness ensures the computation would take exponential time, rendering the attack infeasible.

## 6. Privacy
### 6.1 Features
- **Anonymous Public Keys**: Transactions are unlinkable to real-world identities.
- **Key Pair Rotation**: A new key pair is recommended for each transaction to enhance anonymity.
