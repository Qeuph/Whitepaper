# Qeuph QUH: A Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Protocol

## Abstract
Qeuph QUH is a next-generation quantum-resistant blockchain protocol designed to address vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing to existing blockchain systems. By leveraging FIPS 204 Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard (ML-DSA-87), SHA3-512 hashing, and Bech32m addresses, Qeuph QUH ensures unparalleled security, speed, and efficiency. This document details the core mechanisms, features, and operational principles of the Qeuph QUH blockchain.

## 1. Introduction
Commerce and financial systems on the Internet are at risk due to the impending capabilities of quantum computing, which threaten existing cryptographic protocols like secp256k1 and SHA2-256. To address these vulnerabilities, Qeuph QUH integrates quantum-resistant cryptographic standards to provide a secure, efficient, and future-proof blockchain system. Key integrations include:

- **ML-DSA-87**: A lattice-based digital signature algorithm providing resistance to quantum attacks.
- **SHA3-512**: A hashing mechanism with enhanced security and collision resistance.
- **Bech32m Addresses**: Ensuring efficient, error-resistant encoding for user-friendly transactions.

This whitepaper outlines the design, functionality, and advantages of Qeuph QUH over traditional blockchain protocols.

## 2. Transactions
### 2.1 Defining Qeuph QUH Transactions
A Qeuph QUH transaction is defined as a transfer of QUH coins secured through quantum-resistant digital signatures and robust hashing. Each transaction consists of:

- Inputs referencing previous outputs.
- Outputs designating recipients.
- **txnonce**: Ensuring transaction uniqueness, incremented by 1 for each new transaction.
- Digital signatures generated using **ML-DSA-87** to secure ownership and transfer validity.
- Hashing using **SHA3-512** for transaction IDs and Merkle tree computations.

## 3. Address Generation
Qeuph QUH uses a streamlined address generation process based on Bech32m encoding with the prefix `quh`:

1. A **public key** (2592 hexadecimal characters) is derived using ML-DSA-87.
2. The public key is hashed twice using SHA3-512 to ensure security.
3. The resulting hash is encoded into Bech32m format with the `quh` prefix, creating a user-friendly and error-resistant address.

## 4. Blocks and Consensus Mechanism
### 4.1 Block Structure
Blocks in Qeuph QUH follow a similar structure to Bitcoin but are optimized for quantum resistance:

- **Block Header**: Contains metadata such as the previous block hash, Merkle root (SHA3-512), timestamp, and nonce.
- **Block Time**: Set to 5 minutes, enabling faster transactions.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Occurs every 2048 blocks (approximately 7 days).
- **Initial Block Reward**: 50 QUH, reducing by one-third(Thirding) every 262,144 blocks.

### 4.2 Consensus Algorithm
Qeuph QUH employs Proof-of-Work (PoW) as its consensus mechanism, using SHA3-512 for all hashing. This ensures compatibility with the blockchain’s quantum-resistant principles while maintaining robust security against malicious actors.

## 5. Incentive Model and Supply Dynamics
Qeuph QUH introduces a "thirding" mechanism for reward reduction to replace Bitcoin’s halving model:

- **Reward Reduction**: Block rewards decrease by one-third every 262,144 blocks.
- **Total Supply**: Approximately 19,660,800 QUH will be mined.
- **Mining Timeline**: The entire supply will be distributed over ~52.37 years, balancing supply with demand while sustaining miner incentives.

## 6. Security Considerations
### 6.1 Resistance to Quantum Attacks
ML-DSA-87 and SHA3-512 form the backbone of Qeuph QUH’s security framework, providing:

- Robust resistance to quantum attacks.
- Secure key generation, validation, and transaction signing.

### 6.2 Data Integrity
Using SHA3-512 for all hashes ensures immutability and integrity of the blockchain’s data, preventing tampering or unauthorized modifications.

### 6.3 Address Validation
Bech32m encoding minimizes human and machine errors, enhancing usability and ensuring address validity.

## 7. Reclaiming Disk Space
To ensure scalability and sustainability, Qeuph QUH employs Merkle Trees with SHA3-512 for transaction hashes, enabling efficient disk space reclamation by pruning spent transaction data while retaining necessary historical records.

---

## 8. Privacy
Although Qeuph QUH requires transaction data to be public, privacy is preserved through:

- **Anonymous Public Keys**: Ensuring transactions are visible but unlinkable to real-world identities.
- **New Key Pair Generation**: Encouraged for each transaction to prevent linkage of multiple transactions to a single user.

## 9. Calculations
Qeuph QUH is resistant to chain reorganizations and ensures the security of funds against double-spending attacks through Poisson probability models for consensus validity, similar to Bitcoin’s framework.

---

## 10. Conclusion
Qeuph QUH represents the next generation of blockchain technology, addressing the security challenges posed by quantum computing. Through ML-DSA-87, SHA3-512, and innovative mechanisms like thirding, Qeuph QUH ensures a secure, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain environment for the future.
